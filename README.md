# TFM_Sergio_Garcia_Astrofisica

This repository contains all the code of the Master's Thesis of Sergio García Moreno for the Master's Degree in Astrophysics of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), supervised by Dr. Jonás Chaves-Montero, from the Institut de Física d'Altes Energies (IFAE). This work has been developed during the academic year 2023-2024. It is composed of several files with a determined hierarchy: the 'main.py' file is the first to be executed, calling the rest of files when needed, being followed by the execution of the 'recalc_2pcf.py' file to divide the sample into mass bins. 

Some files are depecrated scripts that can be removed (like the 'main_part2.py') or that have been transformed into scripts from a Jupyter Notebook in order to include all the process of fitting and plotting done for the Thesis. This thesis is available in PDF in the following link:
